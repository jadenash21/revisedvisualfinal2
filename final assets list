I used a free picture of a woman holding up many warped mirrors. I used Unsplash for my initial background picture. They grant free license rights for commercial and noncommerical uses. I pasted their policy underneath. https://unsplash.com/license. All the fonts that I used came straight from Gimp's softwaree. Nothing else besides the Unsplash picture was imported from outside resources.
