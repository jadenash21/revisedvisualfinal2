Welcome to my repository! My project is titled "Mental Health Introspection." I have decided to create this argument to get indiviauls to consider how Mental Health diseases are often invisible. A person may say they are "fine" or have a smiling face on. However, they could be battling a mix of emotions on the inside. The juxtaposition of emotions and experiences a person is going through on the inside is something more people need to consider.How do you depict mental health?
